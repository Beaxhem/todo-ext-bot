# todo-ext-bot
This is my first time trying Telegram API. The demo version of it is here: [@todo_ext_bot](https://telegram.me/todo_ext_bot)

### Installation
* Clone the repository
* Set environment variables for PORT, TOKEN and DATABASE_URL
* Run `python app.py`

### Project structure
The whole project is based on [telegram-bot-python](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) and its ConversationHandler. There is also an SQLAlchemy integration to store all the tasks.  

### Goals
The main goal is to develop the best open source Telegram bot serving a task manager.
